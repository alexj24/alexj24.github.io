                <h2>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity?</h2>
                <p>Not sure if this counts but having worked in a supermarket the past couple of years and aswell as during level 4 lockdowns last year it has given me a new perspective on things.
                    There are a surprising amount of customers who are very rude and demanding no matter how nice you are and how much you try to help them.
                    This has influenced me because now whenever I visit a retail store I try to be extra polite and understandble if there is ever an issue or I have to wait for something. I know most of the time the staff are usually just trying their best.

                <h2>What are your own strengths and limitations in relation to learning?</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Strength - </strong>Strategic. I tend to analyse things a lot before deciding which strategy is the best to go with</li>
                    <li><strong>Strength - </strong>Trustworthy. I can be trusted I say I'm going to do a certain task then I make sure I do it</li>
                    <li><strong>Strength - </strong>Empathetic. I try my best to be as considerate of others as I can</li>
                    <li><strong>Limitation - </strong>Anxiety. Particularly with public speaking and presenting things in front of groups. I think I'll struggle with this and it will hold be back a bit.</li>

            <div class="content">
                <h2>Which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles?</h2>
                <p>Strategic, because I when I come up against a big task I have to do, it will help me think about the ways to complete it. </p>

            <div class="content">
                <h2>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.  </h2>
                <p>Well back when I was at school we had to do a group project. But the others wouldn't be much help and would muck around the whole time. 
                    I didn't want to create any conflict at the time so I ended up just doing majority of the project myself and while we passed with an Achieved mark it could have been a lot better if everyone pitched in.
                    I think the strategy I would use now would in this situation is just to keep motivating the rest of the group and keep reminding them so we all do our fair share of the project.</p>
