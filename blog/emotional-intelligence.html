                <h2>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h2>
                <p>Emotional intelligence is basically the ability to understand how things affect yours and other’s feelings and emotions.  
                    As well as how to manage them in positive ways to do things like relieve stress, communicate with others, and tackle challenges.</p>

                <h2>How is it different to IQ?</h2>
                <p>Well IQ is more about technical knowledge and intelligence of a subject/s whereas EQ is mainly the emotional and feelings side of things</p>
            </div>

            <div class="content">
                <h2>Why is it important?</h2>
                <p>EQ is important because IQ isn’t the only thing needed. Like for example someone may be the smartest person in the room but that doesn’t necessarily mean anyone will want to work with them. 
                    Whereas someone who may not be the smartest, but has a high emotional intelligence is someone people will want to work with.</p>
