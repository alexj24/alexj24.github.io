                <h2> What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>How important it is to have strong core skills</li>
                    <li>To just ask for help I’m unsure rather than struggle for too long being stuck</li>
                    <li>That no matter how dumb I think my question is I should still ask it and find out. I shouldn’t be so self-conscious about being dumb because I’m sure everyone is here to help each other.</li>

                <h2>What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</h2>
                <p>
                    The roles of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming are important ones since it takes more than just intelligence to be good at your job.

                <h2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>
                <p>
                    I didn’t realize how important it was until starting with Dev Academy. I mean obviously people skills are good to have but I always just thought that as long as you can code well then employers wouldn’t care all that much.

                <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>
                <p>
                    For me personally the part I found most challenging was listening and looping. I am not the most talkative person so trying to talk for 2 minutes non-stop was difficult. It also didn't help that I couldn't quite remember the names of some of the parts of JavaScript I was talking about.

                <h2>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h2>
                <p>
                    Dev Academy spends so much time on core learning because tech employers aren't looking for top grades or the person with the most outstanding code. They're looking for exceptional human beings who will enhance the culture of their team.
                </p>
                <p> 
                    Like for example someone may be the smartest person in the room but that doesn’t necessarily mean anyone will want to work with them. Whereas someone who may not be the smartest, but has great core skills is someone people will want to work with.

                <h2>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practising programming instead? Justify your answer.</h2>
                <p>
                    I do enjoy programming more than the core learning, but I do think the core learning is definitely not a waste of time. At the very start I may have thought it was a waste of time but after knowing more about it I think learning the core skills is very useful. Core skills are also helpful outside of just programming in other careers and almost any part of life really.
