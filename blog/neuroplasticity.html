                <h2>How does understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people?</h2>
                <p>
                    Understanding the principles benefits people because imagination and action are linked and engage the same part of the brain. So practising one actually improves the other one. In studies it has been proven that mentally imagining practising a physical skill can actually have almost similar effects as physically practising that skill. Understanding that mental practice is a good way to prepare for physical skills is beneficial to people to reach their full capabilities.

                <h2>How might you engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your own benefit?</h2>
                <p>
                    I would engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for my own benefit by repeatedly practising programming so that the neural networks and pathways shape themselves around it, which would aid in increasing my programming skills.

                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ngs5_WXxfo">Bio Neuroplasticity and Learning</a> - It was one of the videos in the lesson, but I found it very interesting and learnt new things about neuroplasticity that I never knew before.

                <h2>What is growth mindset and why is it relevant</h2>
                <p>
                    A growth mindset is when students believe they can get smarter, they understand that effort makes them better. Therefore, they put in more time and effort, and that leads to higher achievement. It is relevant because it will help you with not just learning skills at Dev Academy but any skill in life. Having a fixed mindset will make things more difficult for yourself and you might not make the best of your full potential.

                <h2>Exploring growth mindset, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h2>
                <p>
                    Before this exploration I had heard of growth mindsets but I didn’t know too much about it. So after knowing more about it now, it surprises me that most of the times in recent memory that I’ve gotten better at a particular skill have been times when I’ve tried to believe that I can do better.

                <h2>How will you integrate a growth mindset into your learning journey?</h2>
                <p>
                    I would integrate a growth mindset into my learning journey by trying to consciously make an effort  to try to think that I can do something by believing it. Rather than putting up a brick wall by thinking I suck at something so therefore I can’t do it

                <h2>A resource that you found particularly useful or engaging about growth mindset?</h2>
                <p>
                    <a href="https://www.mindsetworks.com/science/">Mindset Works</a> - I thought this website was quite useful about growth mindsets. I also found the Brain Pickings website in the optional resources part of the page very informative.
                </p>

            <div class="content">
                <h2>Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and strategy?</h2>
                <p>
                    Exploring neuroplasticity and growth mindsets has been beneficial and they will help me going forward with programming. <br>
                    With growth mindsets I think I had been doing it occasionally a bit in the past year or so and was actually really helpful, but I just never realized that it had a name for it. Now that I know more about it I would definitely like to add it to my learning strategy. I will try to believe that I can do it, particularly when I am faced with a difficult programming problem instead of thinking this is too hard and I can’t. <br>
                    I think engaging with ways of neuroplasticity would help me as well, since I’m a firm believer in practice makes perfect! So if repeatedly practising things helps neural networks and pathways in your brain then I will try to do more of that.
