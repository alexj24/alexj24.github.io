                <h2>Tell a story about how you got blocked on a simple problem?</h2>
                <p>
                    I was doing the Manipulating Objects kata in Sprint 4. I was stuck and feeling really confused on one of the early tests for quite a while. Then I decided to start doing some googling to figure out why I couldn’t get it to work. While looking at my google search results I vaguely remembered there being a few exercises on FreeCodeCamp I did about it. So I went and redid those exercises and I felt so relieved because it was exactly what I needed to know for that kata. I was able to complete it really quickly after that. What I learnt was that I need to keep practicing more so that I can remember without having to go back and relearn.

                <h2>Tell a story about how you solved a problem in an elegant way?</h2>
                <p>
                    It was the FizzBuzz (Super Edition) kata in Sprint 4. The problem solving techniques I used were just trying something and reading the error messages. There were 2 functions for this kata. For the second one, I thought it would be a good idea to basically use the same code as the first function but change it slightly so it would run with the different parameters. At first it didn’t work but I kept making slight adjustments, while also looking at the error messages that were coming back after I ran the code. In the end it worked and I thought this was an elegant and simple way to solve the problem, so I felt pretty happy with that. What I learnt was that it’s good to try things to see if they work and that reading the error messages are very helpful when trying to figure out exactly where you went wrong.

                <h2>How confident do you feel using these problem solving techniques and processes?</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Pseudocode</strong> - I like this technique, I find that writing it all out really helps me visualize what the code is going to look like.</li>
                    <br><li><strong>Rubber Ducky Method</strong> - I haven’t tried explaining my code line-by-line to any ducks because I usually go to other problem solving techniques first but I do think it would be useful for me to practice this.</li>
                    <br><li><strong>Reading Error Messages</strong> - I find this process helpful since it can point you to where exactly in the block of code you have gone wrong.</li>
                    <br><li><strong>Console.logging</strong> - I sometimes use console.logging to solve problems. I find it helpful to figure out which parts of my code are running.</li>
                    <br><li><strong>Googling</strong> - This is a technique I use all the time when I’m stuck. There are lots of others who have run into the same problem so there is always a helpful answer out there somewhere. You just have to know what to search for exactly.</li>
                    <br><li><strong>Trying something</strong> - I'm very confident in trying something, I will use this technique everytime. It is normally the first technique I try before I move onto anything else. </li>
                    <br><li><strong>Asking your peers for help</strong> - I’m not too confident about doing this. I feel a bit stupid asking peers because I don’t want to seem like I dont’t know things. I think this is probably an area I need to improve.</li>
                    <br><li><strong>Asking coaches for help</strong> - I used this technique for one of the katas in sprint 4 and my facilitator helped me out and pointed me in the right direction. I think I wait longer than I should or don’t ask for help because I don't want to seem dumb.</li>
                    <br><li><strong>Improving your process with reflection</strong> - I’m not confident with this but I feel like I’ve been getting better at it since starting at Dev Academy and having to do reflections after everything.</li>
