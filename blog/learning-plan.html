                <h2>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h2>
                <p>I would love to have a career as web developer. I also think I'd be pretty cool to go 
                    overseas to somewhere like Australia or the United States and work for a big company, so that's
                    something I'd like to achieve in the future at some point. 
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="content"> 
                <h2>What are your own strengths and limitations in relation to learning?</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Strength - </strong>Strategic. I tend to analyse things a lot before deciding which strategy is the best to go with</li>
                    <li><strong>Strength - </strong>Trustworthy. I can be trusted I say I'm going to do a certain task then I make sure I do it</li>
                    <li><strong>Strength - </strong>Empathetic. I try my best to be as considerate of others as I can</li>
                    <li><strong>Limitation - </strong>Anxiety. Particularly with public speaking and presenting things in front of groups. I think I'll struggle with this and it will hold be back a bit.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="content">
                <h2>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h2>
                <p>I'd like to see my teamwork skills developed during the course. Since I haven't coded with others besides myself yet.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="content">
                <h2>What will I do to manage my workload throughout this course?</h2>
                <p>I will always try to work to the best of my ability and work efficiently so I'm not wasting 
                    others or my own time.</p>
                <p>When things are building up and starting to get to me I like to think I'll try my best to keep
                    calm and not get too stressed out. I'd also probably talk to my facilitator and other teachers for 
                    some help or advice.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="content">
                <h2>How and where will I seek help?</h2>
                <p>Depending on what the problem I'm having is, I could seek help from different people. 
                    If it's a code related problem I can talk to others in my cohort or any of the teachers.
                    If it's another problem or issue I have I can go talk to my facilitator or other Dev Academy people depending on the problem.
                    How I would seek help would be by talking to them face-to-face or by messaging them on slack if I wasn't at campus.

            <div class="content">
                <h2>What do I expect from the facilitation team</h2>
                <p>I expect to help me achieve the best I can do throughout this course!</p>
            </div>

            <div class="content">
                <h2>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things?</h2>
                <p>I don't really have any commitments that would get in the way of study during the day. 
                    But it is important to me to keep up my physical health, so I enjoy going to the gym or going for 
                    walks or biking. These things can always be done before or after study or on the weekends
